##MOTIVATION 
Never miss the must visit places when you visit Nepal for once in your life. :) :)
We made this app so that a tourist would not miss any must-visit places during their stay in Nepal.

##BUSINESS MODEL
For now, we are targeting Hotel advertisements for business.There are some static photos of hotels from Pokhara with label 'ads'. In future, we will be targeting other methods of business. :) 

##HOW_TO_INSTALL
Tour Nepal is an mobile app for android devices which works on the mobile with minimum SDK API 15 (i.e Icecream Sandwich).
We will email you the apk file for the app because there may be gradle issues while running the app from the project files.
